# NestIndex

A program written in C to compute the nesting index of double occurrence words. Double occurrence words are used to model the recombination of DNA in certain ciliate species. The primary reference/documentation related to this work is my research publication and Master's thesis that you can find [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3543) and [here](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/4979/), respectively. An introduction to the topic of double occurence words / assembly graphs and their use to model DNA recombination in ciliate species can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X09002534). For more general information you can visit the research group's web page which is still active at http://knot.math.usf.edu.

**Be warned:** This is an old project with little or no upkeep.

This program was developed as part of a research project at the University of South Florida with help from advisors Natasha Jonoska and Masahico Saito. The project was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0900671 and NIH grant 1R01GM109459-01.
